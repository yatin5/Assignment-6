/* Exercise #2 - Car Class
 * 
 * Write a class named Car that has the following fields:
 * - yearModel. The yearModel field is an int that holds the car's year model.
 * - make. The make field references a String object that holds the make of the car.
 * - speed. The speed field is an int that holds the car's current speed.
 * In addition, the class should have the following constructor and other methods.
 * - Constructor. The constructor should accept the car's year model and make as
 *     arguments. These values should be assigned to he object's yearModel and 
 *     make fields. The constructor should also assign 0 to the speed field.
 * - Accessors. Appropriate accessor methods should get the values stored in an 
 *     object's yearModel, make, and speed fields.
 * - accelerate. The accelerate method should add 5 to the speed field each time 
 *     it is called.
 * - brake. The brake method should subtract 5 from the speed field each time it 
 *     is called.
 * In the main class (CPD3314Assign6), demonstrate the class in a program that 
 * creates a Car object, and then calls the accelerate method five times. After 
 * each call to the accelerate method, get the current speed of the car and 
 * display it. Then call the brake method five times. After each call to the 
 * brake method, get the current speed of the car and display it.
 * - Gaddis pg. 400-1

/* Exercise #7 - Circle Class
 *
 * Write a Circle class that has the following fields:
 * - radius: a double
 * - PI: a final double initialized with the value 3.14159
 * The class should have the following methods:
 * - Constructor. Accepts the radius of the circle as an argument.
 * - Constructor. A no-arg constructor that sets the radius field to 0.0.
 * - setRadius. A mutator method for the radius field.
 * - getRadius. An accessor method for the radius field.
 * - getArea. Returns the area of the circle, which is calculated as
 *     area = PI * radius * radius
 * - getDiameter. Returns the diameter of the circle, which is calculated as
 *     diameter = radius * 2
 * - getCircumference. Returns the circumference of the circle, which is
 *     calculated as
 *     circumference = 2 * PI * radius
 * In the main class (CPD3314Assign6), demonstrate the Circle class by 
 * asking the user for the circle's radius, creating a Circle object, and 
 * then reporting the circle's area, diameter, and circumference.
 * - Gaddis pg- 402

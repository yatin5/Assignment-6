    /* Exercise #2 - Car Class
     * 
     * Write a class named Car that has the following fields:
     * - yearModel. The yearModel field is an int that holds the car's year model.
     * - make. The make field references a String object that holds the make of the car.
     * - speed. The speed field is an int that holds the car's current speed.
     * In addition, the class should have the following constructor and other methods.
     * - Constructor. The constructor should accept the car's year model and make as
     *     arguments. These values should be assigned to he object's yearModel and 
     *     make fields. The constructor should also assign 0 to the speed field.
     * - Accessors. Appropriate accessor methods should get the values stored in an 
     *     object's yearModel, make, and speed fields.
     * - accelerate. The accelerate method should add 5 to the speed field each time 
     *     it is called.
     * - brake. The brake method should subtract 5 from the speed field each time it 
     *     is called.
     * In the main class (CPD3314Assign6), demonstrate the class in a program that 
     * creates a Car object, and then calls the accelerate method five times. After 
     * each call to the accelerate method, get the current speed of the car and 
     * display it. Then call the brake method five times. After each call to the 
     * brake method, get the current speed of the car and display it.

     *
     * Write a Circle class that has the following fields:
     * - radius: a double
     * - PI: a final double initialized with the value 3.14159
     * The class should have the following methods:
     * - Constructor. Accepts the radius of the circle as an argument.
     * - Constructor. A no-arg constructor that sets the radius field to 0.0.
     * - setRadius. A mutator method for the radius field.
     * - getRadius. An accessor method for the radius field.
     * - getArea. Returns the area of the circle, which is calculated as
     *     area = PI * radius * radius
     * - getDiameter. Returns the diameter of the circle, which is calculated as
     *     diameter = radius * 2
     * - getCircumference. Returns the circumference of the circle, which is
     *     calculated as
     *     circumference = 2 * PI * radius
     * In the main class (CPD3314Assign6), demonstrate the Circle class by 
     * asking the user for the circle's radius, creating a Circle object, and 
     * then reporting the circle's area, diameter, and circumference.

    /* Exercise #10 & 11 - SavingsAccount Class
     * 
     * Design a SavingsAccount class that stores a savings account's annual 
     * interest rate and balance. The class constructor should accept the amount 
     * of the savings account's starting balance. The class should also have 
     * methods for subtracting the amount of a withdrawal, adding the amount of 
     * a deposit, and adding the amount of monthly interest to the balance. The 
     * monthly interest rate the annual interest rate divided by twelve. To add 
     * the monthly interest to the balance, multiply the monthly interest rate 
     * by the balance, and add the result to the balance.
     *
     * NOTE: Not all required methods are described here.

     * are on the right track.
